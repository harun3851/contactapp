## Description
This Full-Stack MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) Contact App is a powerful and efficient application built to manage contacts. It utilizes a modern tech stack, including Tailwind CSS, React Query, Axios, and Context API, to deliver a seamless user experience.
The app development journey starts with building the API using Express, Node.js, and MongoDB, ensuring a robust and scalable backend infrastructure. Using Postman software, the API endpoints are tested thoroughly to guarantee their functionality and reliability.

The user interface is meticulously crafted, employing Tailwind CSS for effortless styling and a sleek design. React Query is implemented for efficient data fetching and caching, ensuring optimal performance and responsiveness.
To help you better understand the development process and the app's features, a comprehensive video tutorial has been created and shared on YouTube. The tutorial covers every step, from setting up the backend API to implementing the frontend using React.js, making it easier for fellow developers to grasp the concepts and build their own applications.
